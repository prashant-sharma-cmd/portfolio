              Hi, I’m Prashant Sharma, a passionate tech enthusiast from Nepal.
              Whether it's coding, AI, or learning, I am constantly driven by
              curiosity to push the boundaries of innovation. Applying my skills
              to real-world problems, I am always eager to contribute to
              projects that make a positive impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was very happy to get accepted into Mercer University for Fall
              2025. And now I am applying to be considered for the Mercer Stamps
              Scholars Program. Deeply excited to join a community that values
              innovation and academic excellence, I look forward to contributing
              to both the university and my field of study.

                Code Hiking was a fun way to engage in sustainability through
                coding. Our team was given the problem about increasing wastes
                in mountain regions. As an solution we designed a
                problem-response website that tracks the concentration of
                pollution over areas and alerts the authorities of the areas
                with urgent needed action.

                  As the Event Coordinator for the Sports Club, I used my
                  leadership and organizational skills very often. I designed
                  tie sheets for smooth event scheduling and managed a dedicated
                  volunteering team on the field during the Annual Sports Week,
                  making sure the event ran seamlessly. I organized weekly
                  training sessions to help participants improve their skills
                  and maintain a competitive spirit. My experience in Sports
                  Club was really valuable and I hope it to be handy even in my
                  college life.

                <h3>Visit to Autism Care Center</h3>
                <p>Date: July 2023</p>
                <p>
                  Our class went to Autism Care Center on the St. Ignatius Day.
                  We were warm welcomed by the teachers there and was made
                  familiar about Autism in brief. We organized several funs
                  activites such as singing, dancing, playing games and more. I
                  was also responsible for teaching origami to students there. I
                  felt the warmt as I spent my time there seeing them smile and
                  grasp the things in their own way.

                <h3>SXC Entrance Exam Volunteering</h3>
                <p>Date: August 2024</p>
                <p>
                  I volunteered during the Grade 11 entrance exams, which had
                  over 10,000 participants. My responsibility was assigning
                  volunteers to their individual classes, managing seat plans in
                  my floor, and guiding students to their respective exam
                  classes. Overall the program ended up being smooth and went on
                  in an organized process. This experience improved my
                  leadership and organizational skills.

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <p>
              I really love hiking to the hilly areas where I can explore the
              beauty of mother nature. A little titbit about above picture, its
              the picture when me and my friends went to Sundarijal, we got lost
              from our original tracks and wandered around for hours pointlessly
              that day. Night came upon us as we exited from the trail.

            <h3>Playing Chess</h3>
            <p>
              I liked playing chess from my childhood. The image shown above is
              the game cover of 'Majestic Chess', it was the first ever chess
              game I played. I liked it since it used story telling approach and
              also had many interesting puzzles. Perfect game to learn about
              chess.

            <h3>Playing Cricket</h3>
            <p>
              Playing cricket always took away my stress and distracted me from
              my problem, so, it holds a significance for me. In the picture,
              above I played one of my finest game scoring about 57 runs in 30
              balls being the last man standing in the team. Even though I never
              played in any official game, the gully cricket was fun.

        <h2>Expresing Myself</h2>
        <div class="experience-container">
          <p>
            Since my childhood, I was always fund of computers. From struggling
            to buy a computer to now applying to study Computer Science in my
            undergraduate, the journey was really full of ups and downs. From
            the troubles when I crashed the computer to the joy of playing games
            in it, everything was sweet experience that led me to this future.
          </p>
          <p>
            There isn't just a single experience that got me interested in
            studying computer science, but multiple. Coding has been something I
            enjoyed due the problem solving skill it required. Building my first
            site about me and my family to now building a site for presenting
            myself for scholarship, I feel like nothing has changed yet it is
            the beginning to the change that will take place in future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Mercer University, I hope to pursue my interest with complete
            passion. I will take my academics not just as academics but
            something fun and enjoyable acitivty. I wish to make the most of my
            time I spend in my studies. Not only do I wish to study but also
            contribute to the mercer community as much as I can. I wish to
            uphold the value Mercer has been strictly following as I embark in
            my journey in solving real-world problems with the helps of computer
            science.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this, I believe being a part of Scholars Program might give me a
            new opportunity to make my education at Mercer affordable. Despite
            belonnging to a poor background, the drive I have towards computer
            science is really high and no matter what I wish to pursue this
            field. Even though I might not be perfect enough to have remarkable
            feats in the field but I believe my time in Mercer will make me fit
            to excel very well.
